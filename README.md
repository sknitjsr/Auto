# Automator - App That Works For You

```
My project is an Android application which aims to connect applications and  create an unique workflow. 
It’s main purpose is to interlink applications and reduce the users work. Automator’s primary task will be 
to interconnect basic applications like SMS service, Wi-Fi service, Location service etc. (phone functionalities) 
with each other in order to simplify users work. It will create a workflow that will automate everyday
functions for the user. It will also provide features for individual and device safety.
